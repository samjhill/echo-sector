# üöÄ Echo Sector

**Echo Sector** is a chill, strategic 2D space survival shooter inspired by the Abyssal Deadspace runs in *EVE Online*. You pilot a modular ship with autonomous drones and fight your way through randomized enemies in an eerie, collapsing sector of space.

The game is designed to be highly playable on both **mobile** and **desktop**, with tap-to-target and orbit-style movement mechanics.
